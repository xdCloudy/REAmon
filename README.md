  REAmon is an AI-assisted reverse-engineering workspace and orchestration platform.
  It accepts arbitrary targets, profiles what it can, resolves compatible analysis
  capabilities, coordinates tools and agents, stores connected evidence, and presents
  the investigation through a live project workspace.

## What REAmon is becoming

REAmon is not an APK reverse-engineer or a Ghidra frontend. A workspace can contain
multiple related targets and artifacts:

```text
Workspace
├── Targets and artifacts
├── Environments and tools
├── Capabilities and agents
├── Tasks, findings, hypotheses, and evidence
├── Knowledge graph and timeline
└── Reports and live activity
```

Targets are intentionally open-ended: files, directories, repositories, processes,
devices, services, remote hosts, captures, filesystems, debug sessions, custom
targets, and unknown inputs. Platform-specific behavior belongs behind capabilities
and plugins rather than in the workspace core.

## Current bootstrap

The first REAmon milestone is implemented and running on the uploaded `reamon/bootstrap`
branch:

- Create or reuse an existing RedAmon project as a REAmon workspace.
- Import an arbitrary file through the workspace UI.
- Persist the target and artifact in PostgreSQL.
- Compute SHA-256 identity and a basic magic/extension/header profile.
- Keep unknown inputs valid instead of rejecting them.
- Resolve compatible built-in capabilities from typed plugin manifests.
- Show targets, artifacts, detected metadata, capabilities, progress, findings,
  hypotheses, evidence, and activity in a real data-backed dashboard.
- Preserve the existing PostgreSQL, Neo4j, agent, MCP, authentication, and event
  infrastructure while migration proceeds incrementally.

The current profiler is deliberately conservative. It is a foundation for a future
provider registry, not a claim of complete binary identification.

## Architecture

The target-to-workflow boundary is:

```text
Target import
    ↓
Target Profiler → TargetProfile / ArtifactProfile
    ↓
Capability Resolver
    ↓
Native plugins · MCP servers · generic process adapters
    ↓
Tasks and analysis plans
    ↓
Evidence, findings, hypotheses, activity, and knowledge graph
```

The initial typed contracts live in [`webapp/src/lib/reamon`](webapp/src/lib/reamon):

- `TargetProfile` describes observable target facts.
- `ToolPluginManifest` describes accepted inputs, capabilities, requirements, and
  produced entities.
- `ToolPlugin` provides the execution boundary without naming a specific platform.
- `resolveCapabilities()` chooses compatible providers from installed manifests.
- `buildProgressModel()` derives progress from persisted lifecycle state.

Read the full design in [`docs/REAMON_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/REAMON_ARCHITECTURE.md)
and the migration inventory in [`docs/REAMON_MIGRATION.md`](docs/REAMON_MIGRATION.md).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose v2
- At least 4 GB RAM for the lightweight stack; more for the inherited scanners
- A local checkout of this repository

Node.js, Python, and reverse-engineering tools run inside containers for the normal
workflow. Do not commit `.env` or real target data.

### Local install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xdCloudy/REAmon.git
cd REAmon

# Compatibility wrapper around the inherited control plane.
./reamon.sh install

# Or use the original script name directly during migration.
# ./redamon.sh install
```

The installer creates the local `.env`, generates deployment secrets, builds the
configured services, starts PostgreSQL/Neo4j/the webapp and supporting workers, and
offers to create the first administrator. Open <http://localhost:3000> after the
webapp is healthy.

For an existing installation:

```bash
./reamon.sh up
./reamon.sh status
./reamon.sh logs webapp
./reamon.sh down
```

The legacy `redamon.sh` name remains intentionally supported while the control plane
is migrated. Compose service and volume identifiers also remain compatible with
existing installations; that compatibility is tracked in the migration document.

### First REAmon workflow

1. Sign in and create a project/workspace.
2. Open the workspace dashboard at `/projects/<project-id>`.
3. Choose any local artifact and optionally give the target a name.
4. Select **Import and profile**.
5. Review the detected format, platform/runtime hints, compatible capabilities,
   deterministic lifecycle progress, and profiler activity.

Artifacts are stored in the named `reamon_artifacts` volume. The default per-file
limit is 64 MiB; set `REAMON_MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` in `.env` before starting the
webapp to change it. Keep the artifact volume backed up with the PostgreSQL and
Neo4j data volumes.

## Production deployment

The default Compose file is suitable for a trusted local network and development
environments. For an internet-facing deployment, use the hardened single-host
deployment under [`tooling/deploy/single-host`](tooling/deploy/single-host), which
adds TLS termination, firewall/SSH hardening, and keeps internal services private.

Before exposing a deployment:

- Set unique, high-entropy values for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`,
  `AUTH_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, and `ORCHESTRATOR_API_KEY`.
- Keep `MCP_SERVER_ENABLED=false` until inbound MCP access is deliberately
  configured and reviewed.
- Set `TRUST_PROXY=true` only when every request reaches the app through a trusted
  proxy that overwrites forwarding headers.
- Set `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` and `AGENT_WS_PUBLIC_URL` to the deployment origin when
  using a reverse proxy.
- Back up `postgres_data`, `neo4j_data`, and `reamon_artifacts` before upgrades.
- Review [`THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md) before redistribution.
- Do not upload real target data to a development or shared environment.

The webapp entrypoint synchronises the Prisma schema on startup to preserve the
upstream self-hosting workflow. Take a database backup and inspect schema changes
before upgrading a production instance.

## Development

The repository is a Docker-orchestrated monorepo. The webapp is Next.js 16, React 19,
TypeScript, Prisma, and Vitest; the agent, recon, MCP, and orchestration services are
Python-based.

```bash
# Validate the Compose model without starting services.
docker compose config --quiet

# Build the webapp image.
docker compose build webapp

# Start the lightweight development stack.
docker compose up -d postgres neo4j webapp

# Validate the REAmon foundation inside the webapp environment.
docker compose exec webapp npm run test -- src/lib/reamon
docker compose exec webapp npm run type-check
```

The repository test policy is documented in [`docs/readmes/README.TESTING.md`](docs/readmes/README.TESTING.md)
and [`skills/redamon-testing/SKILL.md`](skills/redamon-testing/SKILL.md). The normal
gate is containerized; do not run host Python tests against the service code.

Useful top-level commands remain available through the compatibility wrapper:

```text
./reamon.sh install       Build and start the stack
./reamon.sh update        Pull/rebuild the configured deployment
./reamon.sh up            Start already-built services
./reamon.sh status        Show service status
./reamon.sh test unit     Run the unit gate
./reamon.sh create-admin  Create or reset an administrator
./reamon.sh down          Stop services without deleting data
```

## Roadmap

1. Persist a provider registry and execute native, MCP, and generic process tools.
2. Add task scheduling, cancellation, approvals, and live event streaming for
   target-agnostic analysis workflows.
3. Ingest universal code/data/runtime entities and relationships into Neo4j.
4. Migrate the inherited project, agent, report, and settings surfaces away from
   engagement/recon terminology without breaking existing data.
5. Add capability-specific dashboards and reports while retaining one workspace
   framework for every target type.

## Provenance and licence

REAmon originated as a fork of [RedAmon](https://github.com/samugit83/redamon).
Original attribution, copyright notices, and the MIT licence are retained. The
current repository is maintained at <https://github.com/xdCloudy/REAmon>.

RedAmon-specific systems are being isolated or generalised rather than silently
represented as complete REAmon functionality. See the migration table for the
 status of each subsystem. Third-party tools remain subject to their own licences.
