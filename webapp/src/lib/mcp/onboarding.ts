/**
 * Agent Onboarding: the pack that teaches an EXTERNAL agent how to use RedAmon.
 *
 * A connected MCP client already gets every tool's name, description and
 * argument schema from `tools/list`. What it cannot get from the protocol is
 * the part that spans tools and the part that spans the product: what RedAmon
 * is, what its recon pipeline produces, the lifecycle a project moves through,
 * and the honest-reporting rules that stop an unattended agent turning an empty
 * result into a false "all clear". That is what this renders.
 *
 * Two outputs, one source:
 *
 *  - `renderOnboardingPack` writes a `SKILL.md` plus `references/*.md`, for the
 *    clients that load a skill file (the Claude family).
 *  - `renderInlineOnboarding` writes the short `instructions` string the server
 *    sends at `initialize`, which is the ONLY onboarding every other client
 *    (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Goose, the agent SDKs) ever sees.
 *
 * Built like apiReference.ts: the machine-readable half comes from the server's
 * own `tools/list`, so a surface that grew from 13 tools to 30 in a day cannot
 * strand the pack. The judgement half is hand-written in playbook.ts and
 * profiles.ts, and coverage tests force it to stay complete.
 *
 * TWO FILTERS, and collapsing them collapses the design:
 *
 *  - the SCOPE filter is hard. A tool whose scope this token lacks is never
 *    presented as available; it appears only in the "what this token cannot do"
 *    tail, so the agent stops looking for it.
 *  - the PROFILE filter is editorial. It chooses which workflows and which tone
 *    are emphasised, and nothing more.
 *
 * Deterministic by construction: no dates, and the version stamp is injected,
 * so the same inputs render byte-identical output.
 *
 * NOTHING user-specific may enter this output. No token, no project name, no
 * target, no rules-of-engagement text. A SKILL.md gets committed into a
 * repository, and the agent discovers projects at run time instead.
