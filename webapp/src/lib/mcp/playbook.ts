/**
 * The hand-written half of the Agent Onboarding pack.
 *
 * `tools/list` already gives a connected client every tool's name, description
 * and argument schema, and the generator reads those live so they cannot drift.
 * What the protocol CANNOT express is the part that spans tools: when to reach
 * for this one rather than that one, and the trap that makes a call succeed
 * while answering wrongly. That is what lives here.
 *
 * Three registries, each guarded by a coverage test in onboarding.test.ts:
 *
 *  - `CAPABILITY_AREAS` groups every tool by what an agent uses it FOR. Every
 *    registered tool must appear in exactly one area.
 *  - `ONBOARDING_PLAYBOOK` carries one entry per tool. A new tool cannot ship
 *    without guidance, because the coverage test goes red in the same commit.
 *  - `WORKFLOWS` are the cross-tool procedures, each rendered only when the
 *    token can call every tool it needs. That one mechanism handles both
 *    per-token permissions and a deployment that has withdrawn a tool.
 *
 * Response-shape facts quoted here (`liveGraphState` values, the section names,
 * `stale_since`, the verdict vocabulary) are NOT in `tools/list`, so the
 * generator cannot catch them drifting. onboarding.test.ts pins each of them
 * against the module that owns it instead.
