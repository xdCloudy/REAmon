# Adaptive build parallelism (memory-safe Docker builds)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Next.js `webapp` image build peaks at several GB of RAM. Building it in
# parallel with the heavy `agent` image (pip install + large layer export) has
# OOM-killed the webapp build on low-memory hosts ("Killed" / exit code 137).
# Two-layer mitigation, applied to EVERY `docker compose build` in this script
# via compose_build():
#   Layer 1: always build `webapp` on its own first. Once built its layers are
#            cached, so it never compiles concurrently with another image.
#   Layer 2: build the remaining images in BATCHES sized from the memory/CPU
#            actually available to the Docker BUILD ENGINE.
#
# Layer 2 pages the service list through `docker compose build` N names at a time
# rather than handing over the whole list with COMPOSE_PARALLEL_LIMIT set. That
# env var is only a hint: Compose v5 / Docker 29 delegate every build to bake,
# which hands all targets to buildx in ONE invocation and starts them together.
# Issue #171 is what that looks like in practice -- a host that logged
# "parallelism=3" then built 16 images at once, starving pip of bandwidth until it
# timed out. A batch cannot exceed its own length, so the cap holds regardless of
# what the builder does with the hint (which is still set, for older Compose).
# The cost is a barrier between batches; that is the point of the guarantee.
#
# Cross-platform: on macOS/Windows the Docker Desktop builder runs inside a Linux
# VM whose memory is capped independently of host RAM, so reading host RAM would
# be misleading. `docker info` reports the engine's real limits and is correct on
# Linux, macOS and Windows alike; host probing (/proc, sysctl) is only a fallback.
#
# Override: REDAMON_BUILD_PARALLEL=N forces the limit (N>=1), =0 leaves it
# unbounded. webapp isolation always applies regardless of the override.

# Proportional memory allocator
#
# ONE input -- the host's MemTotal -- and every limit is a percentage of it.
# There are no fixed sizes here: a bigger host gets bigger limits, at every size,
# without touching config. The previous scheme gave each service an independent
# percentage with a hard ceiling, which meant the always-on services took 89% of
# an 8 GB host and 4% of a 512 GB one, and four services were not sized at all.
#
#   os_reserve = MemTotal x OS_RESERVE_PCT
#   usable     = MemTotal - os_reserve
#   services   = usable x SERVICES_PCT          <- the guaranteed budget
#   scan_pool  = usable - services              <- what admission may hand out
#   service_i  = services x weight_i / SUM(weights)
#
# TIERS. `mem_limit` is a ceiling, not a reservation, so unused headroom costs
# nothing and may be over-committed -- EXCEPT where the process really allocates
# its share up front. Neo4j pre-allocates the page cache and Postgres its
# shared_buffers, so those are `r` (reserved) and are never multiplied. Every
# other service is `b` (burst) and gets BURST_FACTOR x its fair share, so one
# busy service can use the headroom the others are not touching. A third tier
# `t` (transient) is for one-shot containers that exit before the stack is in
# use and whose ceiling covers reclaimable page cache rather than an anonymous
# allocation: those sit outside the over-commit accounting entirely.
#
# FLOORS are the only absolute numbers, and they are a property of the SOFTWARE
# (a JVM cannot boot in 128 MB), not of the host. They never bind at >= 8 GB; on
# a smaller host the allocator reports infeasible rather than handing out limits
# that cannot work. The one exception is GVM_DATA, whose requirement is set by
# the size of the Greenbone feed rather than by the host, so its per-container
# floor binds at every realistic host size -- see _GVM_DATA_MIN_MB.
#
# Every knob is a percentage and env-overridable. Keep the weights in sync with
# docs/readmes/README.MEMORY_GOVERNOR.md.

# there are only 4 CPUs available" -- so on a 4-vCPU VM every `docker compose
# up` died before the stack came up. Clamp each cap to the detected core count.
# `cpus:` is a limit, not a reservation, so clamping loses nothing: the core
# count was already the real ceiling. Keep these defaults in sync with

# default on first boot and exposes NO env var to preset it — so, exactly like an
# already-initialised Neo4j volume, the ONLY effective path is to let it boot on
# the default and then rotate. This half runs PRE-`up`: it generates a strong
# GVM_PASSWORD and pins it in .env so the recon-orchestrator (which reads
# GVM_PASSWORD to spawn GVM scan containers, docker-compose.yml) gets the strong
# value the moment it starts; reconcile_gvm_admin_password() applies the same
# value to the live gvmd 'admin' user once gvmd is healthy (POST-`up`). Only acts

#   - `install` ends in `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`, so without this
#     a FRESH install created every container with the compose fallbacks and
#     wrote no .env block at all -- the allocation only appeared after the first
#     later `up`.
#   - `up dev` (cmd_up_dev) never called it either.
#   - `update` called it only when docker-compose.yml itself had changed, so a
#     release that touched only source, or a host that had been RESIZED, kept the
#     previous allocation.
# Running it here also means the .env block is written BEFORE any `docker compose
# up` in those commands reads it.
